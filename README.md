In this project for Scrimba's Front End Developer Path, I created a dashboard page and then converted it to a Chrome Extension. It calls upon various APIs, such as:
- Coingecko for Solana's current information
- Open Weather for current Geolocation weather icon/temperature and city. 
- Unsplash for images of South Korea and the photographer in the bottom right corner. 

I got to cover: 
- clients/servers
- request/response cycle
- how JSON can be used to send/receive information across the internet. 
- fetch / .then() / promises / promise resolutions
- requests (methods, headers, body, URL)
REST API Design (params, query strings, nested resources etc)
Async JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)

I want to continue to add some more features to this extension, such as: 
- more tickers
- Image caching 
- Loading icons (maybe a loading spinner whilst the actual weather information is being pulled)
- Photographer name to link to their Unsplash page?
- some quotes? 
- Todo list?
